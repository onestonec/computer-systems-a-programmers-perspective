typedef struct {
		int x[A][B];	//Unknown contants A and B
		long y;
} str1;

typedef struct {
	char array[B];
	int t;
	short s[A];
	long u;
} str2;

void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) {
	long v1 = q->t;
	long v2 = q->u;
	p->y = v1 + v2;
}

GCC generates the following code for the body of setVal:

void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) 
p in %rdi, q in %rsi
setVal:
	movslq	8(%rsi),	%rax		//get t (t is at 8 offset from *q)
	addq	32(%rsi),	%rax		//add u to t and store in %rax
	movq 	%rax,		184(%rdi)	//move result to p->y
	ret

Answer:

1. Because t starts at position 8, implying char array[B] is either a full array of 8 characters or with padding from 5-8 (because if it the array size is less than or equal to 4, t will start at 4 instead)
    - We can deduce that B is 4 < B <= 8

2. Because u starts at 32, and u is long (8-byte), implying that the previous data structure positions adds to a position either a) above 24 with padding b) tops at 32 
    - We can deduce that A is 24 < 8 + 4 + 2A <= 32, yielding 6 < A <= 10

3. Looking at str1, y (a long with 8-byte) starts at 184, implying the previous int x[A][B] is either at position a) above 176 with padding b) tops at 184
    - We can deduce that 176 < 4AB <= 184, yielding 44 < AB <= 46

4. The only A and B combination that satisfies 44 < AB <= 46 within their respective constrains is A = 9, B = 5
